The **Energy Efficient Heating with Sustainable Wood Materials** initiative aims to optimize domestic and industrial heating systems using natural, low-impact materials. By utilizing locally sourced wood processed through energy-efficient and environmentally friendly methods, the project contributes to reducing emissions and improving indoor air quality, making spaces healthier for both people and animals.

**Project Overview:**
- **Material Sourcing:** Reclaimed wood from riverbank, forest, and woodland maintenance in the Cuneo region.
- **Processing Techniques:** Low-energy, eco-friendly treatments to preserve natural properties while enhancing thermal insulation.
- **Health Benefits:** Reduced emission of harmful substances from materials when installed indoors.

### Project Details

The reclaimed wood is processed and characterized in labs to optimize its insulating properties, with preliminary research showing a potential 4% increase in thermal conductivity when treated properly. Collaboration with the **Politecnico di Torino** supports quantitative and scientific analysis to identify the most effective types of wood and treatments for thermal insulation and heat transfer, especially for applications like underfloor heating.

Using Cuneo as a case study for sustainable practices, the project serves as a model for balancing energy efficiency with environmental stewardship.

### Partners

- **DIMEAS - Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering**
- **Brondello Erminio SAS**
- **Goletto Legnami**
- **Politecnico di Torino - Administration**
- **Segheria Cervella**

This initiative showcases a sustainable production cycle, transforming reclaimed wood into efficient heating materials that contribute to energy-saving goals and support local economies.
