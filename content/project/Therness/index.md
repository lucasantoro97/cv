Thernness is proud to be selected for Tech4Planet’s Pre-seed investment, leveraging cutting-edge thermography to monitor processes and assess the mechanical and thermal properties of materials and components. Our mission is to enhance safety and significantly reduce waste through innovative non-destructive testing (NDT) solutions. Originating from the Thexor research group at Politecnico di Torino, which boasts over 30 years of expertise in thermography and NDT, Thernness brings a wealth of knowledge and experience to the field.

The global NDT market is projected to reach €18.4 billion, underscoring the increasing demand for reliable and advanced technologies like those developed by Thernness. With support from Tech4Planet’s Proof of Concept (POC) investment, we are developing an automated thermographic system for in-line monitoring of metal welding processes. This state-of-the-art system ensures 100% observation of welding operations, enhancing existing control mechanisms required by industry standards to promptly identify potential anomalies.

Thernness is backed by Tech4Planet, Italy's National Technology Transfer Hub for environmental sustainability, initiated by CDP Venture Capital SGR. The initiative brings together top institutions like Politecnico di Milano, Politecnico di Torino, and Politecnico di Bari as Scientific Promoters, with key technical partners including PoliHub, I3P, and BINP. This collaborative ecosystem is further strengthened by co-investors such as Fondazione Politecnico di Milano, a2a, Gruppo Iren, and NEVA SGR, as well as Corporate Partners like Joule (Eni’s business school) and Snam, driving forward our mission to redefine non-destructive testing for a sustainable future.
