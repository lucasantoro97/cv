The **NDTxW** project focuses on developing non-destructive testing (NDT) methods for assessing the quality of welded joints using active thermography. This technique is essential for ensuring the structural integrity and mechanical properties of assembled components without the drawbacks of traditional destructive methods, which are costly and environmentally taxing.

**Project Details:**
- **Duration:** September 15, 2024 - March 14, 2025
- **Scientific Coordinator:** Prof.ssa Manuela De Maddis
- **Project Type:** Research funded by Private Entities and Foundations
- **Funding Entity:** Private (Fondazione Compagnia San Paolo)


This project addresses the need for reliable, precise, and eco-friendly inspection methods by leveraging active thermography. Through a frequency-modulated heat source, the thermal response of the weld joint is analyzed in both time and frequency domains. Post-processing algorithms correlate this thermal data with the jointâ€™s structural characteristics, facilitating an accurate quality assessment.

Implementing this technology in industrial assembly lines enables systematic non-destructive inspections of weld joints without disrupting production. This approach minimizes waste, avoids unnecessary rework, and significantly reduces environmental impact while maintaining high standards of quality and safety. Unlike other NDT methods, this technology is cost-effective, quick to apply, and seamlessly integrates into existing production lines, providing substantial economic and environmental benefits.
