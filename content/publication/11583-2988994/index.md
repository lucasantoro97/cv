abstract: 'This study presents the preliminary outcomes of a methodology for the physical
  and mechanical characterization of various chestnut elements in different states
  of preservation. Strategizing conservation and retrofit interventions for timber
  is necessary, and to do this, it is necessary to establish an estimation of physical
  (transmissivity, thermal conductivity, humidity level, etc.) and mechanical properties
  (density, compressive or bending strength, etc.). This essential information is
  typically associated with timber defects, but there are lack of correlations. The
  primary objective is to establish correlations between thermal and density properties
  with the aim of preserving original assets. The investigation delves into the relationship
  between timber density and thermal properties through experimental non-destructive
  testing (NDT). Two NDTs were employed with the aim of correlating: penetrometric
  testing and active thermography investigations. The parametric study on the excitation
  period yielded valuable insights into the temporal dynamics of heat transfer within
  the timber, underscoring the significance of selecting appropriate excitation periods
  to capture precise thermal properties. Tabular data on relative humidity for salified,
  dried, and new samples provided a quantitative backdrop to these observations, unveiling
  the nuanced effects of humidity on the timber’s thermal response. The results of
  this study are positioned to inform future conservation efforts by laying the groundwork
  for a comprehensive understanding of timber’s mechanical properties. Particularly,
  the challenge lies in accurately estimating density, where surface tests are often
  less reliable than in-depth ones. Therefore, it is crucial to seek validation through
  other NDT tests, such as thermographic analysis and visual inspection, and hygrometric
  tests recognizing their importance in enhancing the reliability of density assessments.
  This approach will contribute to the development of more discerning preservation
  strategies.'
