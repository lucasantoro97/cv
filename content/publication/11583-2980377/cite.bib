 abstract = {This work reports the results of an experimental investigation of the coupled effects of
component thickness and paint coating on metal components surfaces, in surface temperature
measurements by means of pulsed active thermograpy technique. A set of tests were performed
using a steel US calibration block, with and without paint coating, where thermal energy is
input on the target surface by means of a laser beam. The heating and cooling profiles are
processed and and compared. It results that paint coating affects the transient thermal profiles
and adequate average and calibration procedures allow correlating the profiles with the
thickness.},
