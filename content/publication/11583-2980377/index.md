abstract: This work reports the results of an experimental investigation of the coupled
  effects of component thickness and paint coating on metal components surfaces, in
  surface temperature measurements by means of pulsed active thermograpy technique.
  A set of tests were performed using a steel US calibration block, with and without
  paint coating, where thermal energy is input on the target surface by means of a
  laser beam. The heating and cooling profiles are processed and and compared. It
  results that paint coating affects the transient thermal profiles and adequate average
  and calibration procedures allow correlating the profiles with the thickness.
