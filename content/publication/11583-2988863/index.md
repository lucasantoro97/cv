abstract: This study presents a comprehensive understanding of the fatigue behavior
  of 316L stainless steel specimens produced using the laser powder bed fusion (PBF-LB/M)
  method. The investigation has been conducted through a multifaceted approach that
  includes surface roughness analysis, density measurements, microstructural examination,
  fatigue testing, strain measurements, and thermographic analysis. Thermographic
  data processing models, i.e. the bipower law (TCM-modified) model and the TCM method,
  are applied to fatigue test results of standard samples to evaluate fatigue limit
  values. The fatigue limit of the samples was estimated using the Murakami Method
  (MM), Constant Amplitude Loading (CAL) and Step Loading (SL) tests. The proposed
  methodology allows exploration of the entire stress level range within a single
  test, which could allow evaluation of the fatigue limit of components within only
  one test. This study is the starting point for a rapid evaluation method for estimating
  the fatigue limit using thermography, offering a cost-effective, time-efficient,
  and non-destructive means of assessing the fatigue performance of materials produced
  using additive manufacturing processes.
