 abstract = {This study presents a comprehensive understanding of the fatigue behavior of 316L stainless steel specimens produced using the laser powder bed fusion (PBF-LB/M) method. The
investigation has been conducted through a multifaceted approach that includes surface
roughness analysis, density measurements, microstructural examination, fatigue testing, strain
measurements, and thermographic analysis. Thermographic data processing models, i.e. the bipower law (TCM-modified) model and the TCM method, are applied to fatigue test results of
standard samples to evaluate fatigue limit values. The fatigue limit of the samples was estimated
using the Murakami Method (MM), Constant Amplitude Loading (CAL) and Step Loading (SL)
tests. The proposed methodology allows exploration of the entire stress level range within a
single test, which could allow evaluation of the fatigue limit of components within only one
test. This study is the starting point for a rapid evaluation method for estimating the fatigue
limit using thermography, offering a cost-effective, time-efficient, and non-destructive means of
assessing the fatigue performance of materials produced using additive manufacturing processes.},
