abstract: In welding processes, the in-line identification of defects during manufacturing
  is a key aspect of a safe, reliable and economical process. Among the various non-destructive
  techniques, thermography is a particularly suitable technique as it is a non-contact
  full-field technique. However, this technique still has aspects to be improved,
  in particular as regards the definition of the resolution and the quantification
  of the extent of welding non-conformities in industrial production contexts. In
  the present work, an approach based on real-time defect detection on welded joints
  supported by its numerical model is proposed and analyzed for two arc welding processes,
  SMAW and GMAW on a steel alloy by means of active thermography, in order to reduce
  the time and costs of inspections. Different defects are identified, outlined, and
  discussed. Furthermore, a metallographic analysis is carried out to verify the accuracy
  of the model.
