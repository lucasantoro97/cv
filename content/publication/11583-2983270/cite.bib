 abstract = {Ancient wooden artifacts are vulnerable to deterioration from a variety of environmental and human factors. It is challenging to comprehend the assessment when the wooden part is placed inside a construction without performing a diagnostic procedure. While working with ancient wooden structures, tradition and preservation of the architectural, technological, and historical heritage are crucial. A series of non-destructive tests (NDT) must be carried out and developed in order to preserve and determine the nature of the structure and comprehend how to maintain it because wood is also a significantly heterogeneous material. Thermographic techniques are well recognized to be non-destructive, contactless, complete field techniques and are already common in the artistic sector. However, there is the possibility of estimating the physical properties (for example transmissivity, thermal conductivity, humidity level, etc.) and mechanical characteristics (density, compressive or bending strength, etc.), critical information, linked usually with wooden defects, when it comes to planning interventions of conservation. This work presents the preliminary results of a physical and mechanical characterization methodology of different chestnut elements in different states of conservation, with the aim of correlating thermal and density properties, for the purpose of conserving artistic assets.},
