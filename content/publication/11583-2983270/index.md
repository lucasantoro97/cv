abstract: Ancient wooden artifacts are vulnerable to deterioration from a variety
  of environmental and human factors. It is challenging to comprehend the assessment
  when the wooden part is placed inside a construction without performing a diagnostic
  procedure. While working with ancient wooden structures, tradition and preservation
  of the architectural, technological, and historical heritage are crucial. A series
  of non-destructive tests (NDT) must be carried out and developed in order to preserve
  and determine the nature of the structure and comprehend how to maintain it because
  wood is also a significantly heterogeneous material. Thermographic techniques are
  well recognized to be non-destructive, contactless, complete field techniques and
  are already common in the artistic sector. However, there is the possibility of
  estimating the physical properties (for example transmissivity, thermal conductivity,
  humidity level, etc.) and mechanical characteristics (density, compressive or bending
  strength, etc.), critical information, linked usually with wooden defects, when
  it comes to planning interventions of conservation. This work presents the preliminary
  results of a physical and mechanical characterization methodology of different chestnut
  elements in different states of conservation, with the aim of correlating thermal
  and density properties, for the purpose of conserving artistic assets.
