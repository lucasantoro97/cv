 abstract = {Resistance spot welding (RSW) is considered a preferred technique for joining metal parts in various industries, mainly for its efficiency and cost-effectiveness. The mechanical properties of spot welds are pivotal in ensuring structural integrity and overall assembly performance. In this work, the quality attributes of resistance spot welding, such as both nugget and corona bond sizes, are assessed by analyzing the thermal behavior of the joint using a physical information neural network (PINN). Starting from the thermal signal phase gradient and amplitude gradient maps, a convolutional neural network (CNN) estimates the size of nuggets and corona bonds. The CNN architecture is based on the Inception V3 architecture, a state-of-the-art neural network that excels in image recognition tasks. This study suggests adopting a new methodology for automatic RSW quality control based on thermal signal analysis.},
