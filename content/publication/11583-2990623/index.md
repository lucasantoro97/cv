abstract: Resistance spot welding (RSW) is considered a preferred technique for joining
  metal parts in various industries, mainly for its efficiency and cost-effectiveness.
  The mechanical properties of spot welds are pivotal in ensuring structural integrity
  and overall assembly performance. In this work, the quality attributes of resistance
  spot welding, such as both nugget and corona bond sizes, are assessed by analyzing
  the thermal behavior of the joint using a physical information neural network (PINN).
  Starting from the thermal signal phase gradient and amplitude gradient maps, a convolutional
  neural network (CNN) estimates the size of nuggets and corona bonds. The CNN architecture
  is based on the Inception V3 architecture, a state-of-the-art neural network that
  excels in image recognition tasks. This study suggests adopting a new methodology
  for automatic RSW quality control based on thermal signal analysis.
