 abstract = {In the present paper, the results of a research focused on microstructure investigation of steel welded joints by means of non
destructive thermographic technique are presented. In particular, two rough joints obtained by means of irregular manual
welding are analyzed. Active lock in thermography phase analysis is applied, basing on the evidence that thermal diffusivity
is related to the thermal diffusion length, using the phase contrast trend as a function of the distance from the laser spot.
Diffusivity is expected to be dependent on the local microstructure and vary through different directions. By the variation
in diffusivity, it is possible to investigate the level of anisotropy.The results are compared with micrographic analysis. The
proposed method provides an active lock-in infrared thermography analysis by means of a thermal camera and an exciting
laser head to evaluate thermal diffusivity.},
