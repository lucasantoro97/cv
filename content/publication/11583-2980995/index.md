abstract: In the present paper, the results of a research focused on microstructure
  investigation of steel welded joints by means of non destructive thermographic technique
  are presented. In particular, two rough joints obtained by means of irregular manual
  welding are analyzed. Active lock in thermography phase analysis is applied, basing
  on the evidence that thermal diffusivity is related to the thermal diffusion length,
  using the phase contrast trend as a function of the distance from the laser spot.
  Diffusivity is expected to be dependent on the local microstructure and vary through
  different directions. By the variation in diffusivity, it is possible to investigate
  the level of anisotropy.The results are compared with micrographic analysis. The
  proposed method provides an active lock-in infrared thermography analysis by means
  of a thermal camera and an exciting laser head to evaluate thermal diffusivity.
