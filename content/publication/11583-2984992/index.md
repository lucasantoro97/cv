abstract: The thermal and electrical responses of additive manufactured specimens
  were analysed for a additive manufactured steel magnetic shield as a case study.
  The analysis was based on the evidence that variations in the thermal properties
  of a material can be measured as a phase delay in thermal diffusion through the
  material bulk. The signal post-processing was performed, and the results were presented
  in a phase diagram. The results showed that after heat treatment, the slope of the
  phase diagram changed to less steep, indicating an increase in thermal diffusivity
  and hence thermal conductivity. The electrical conductivity was predicted using
  the thermal conductivity and the Weidemann-Franz law and validated by experimental
  measurements of the electrical conductivity. The same approach was applied to predict
  the electrical conductivity in the magnetic shielding, taking into consideration
  the scaling of the density due to porosity. The results showed that the thermographic
  non-destructive full field non-contact approach can be used to evaluate the electrical
  properties of a component and that the heat-treated specimens show better thermal
  diffusivity and hence thermal and electrical conductivity.
