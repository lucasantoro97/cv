abstract: The non-destructive full-field non-contact thermographic technique is applied
  for non-destructive flaw detection of the welded joints, in real-time and offline
  configuration. In this paper, a thermographic procedure for real-time flaw detection
  in manual arc welding process is presented. Surface temperature acquisitions by
  means of an IR camera were performed during arc welding process of 8 specimen both
  for calibration and validation of the numerical model. The investigated variables
  are the technique (manual stick arc (SMAW) and gas arc (GMAW) welding) and the joint
  shape (butt and T joint) for steel joints, in sound conditions and with artificial
  flaws. Numerical simulation of welding thermal transients was run to obtain the
  expected surface temperature fields and thermal behavior for different welding parameter
  configurations. Hardness measurement and micro-graphic analysis were performed to
  validate numerical simulation results. The real-time thermographic study of the
  weld pool gives direct indications of anomalies; local studies of the thermal transient
  and thermal profiles can detect some kind of flaws; microstructural analysis of
  Heat-Affected Zone (HAZ) and surrounding areas higlights the presence of austenite
  and martensite distribution which justifies the thermal transients and thermal profiles
  for different welding configurations. Comparing real-time IR acquisition of the
  welding process with simulated thermal contours of sound processes provides information
  of presence of some kind of flaws. Since most of the flaws are generated in the
  weld pool, it is possible to recognize anomalies directly from the thermal acquisitions
  or with post-processing the acquired data.
