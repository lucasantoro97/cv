 abstract = {The non-destructive full-field non-contact thermographic technique is applied for non-destructive flaw detection of the welded joints, in real-time and offline configuration. In this paper, a thermographic procedure for real-time flaw detection in manual arc welding process is presented. Surface temperature acquisitions by means of an IR camera were performed during arc welding process of 8 specimen both for calibration and validation of the numerical model. The investigated variables are the technique (manual stick arc (SMAW) and gas arc (GMAW) welding) and the joint shape (butt and T joint) for steel joints, in sound conditions and with artificial flaws. Numerical simulation of welding thermal transients was run to obtain the expected surface temperature fields and thermal behavior for different welding parameter configurations. Hardness measurement and micro-graphic analysis were performed to validate numerical simulation results. The real-time thermographic study of the weld pool gives direct indications of anomalies; local studies of the thermal transient and thermal profiles can detect some kind of flaws; microstructural analysis of Heat-Affected Zone (HAZ) and surrounding areas higlights the presence of austenite and martensite distribution which justifies the thermal transients and thermal profiles for different welding configurations. Comparing real-time IR acquisition of the welding process with simulated thermal contours of sound processes provides information of presence of some kind of flaws. Since most of the flaws are generated in the weld pool, it is possible to recognize anomalies directly from the thermal acquisitions or with post-processing the acquired data.},
