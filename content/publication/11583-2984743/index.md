abstract: Resistance spot welding (RSW) is a widely employed technique for joining
  metallic components in different sectors of various industries. However, the quality
  of the weld joints has a significant influence on the mechanical properties of the
  joints. This paper presents an innovative non-destructive inspection technology
  based on active thermography for assessing the welding quality as a function of
  the peak load. By employing a frequency-modulated laser heat source, we analyze
  the thermal signal that traverses the weld joint section. Then, we establish a correlation
  between welding quality and the information derived from spot size and internal
  uniformity analysis. Furthermore, the proposed methodology shows potential for in-line
  testing of resistance spot welding, offering easy automation and enabling the classification
  of spot-welded joints
