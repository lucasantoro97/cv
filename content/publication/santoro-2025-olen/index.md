abstract: Active thermography (AT) has emerged as a critical non-destructive testing
  and evaluation (NDT&E) technique for identifying subsurface defects in diverse industrial
  materials. Despite its widespread application, AT faces challenges such as inadequate
  heat input, noisy thermal signals, and non-uniform heating, which can obscure defect
  detection. This study introduces an enhanced approach leveraging flying spot laser
  thermography combined with advanced signal processing techniques to address these
  challenges. A meticulously designed calibration block, embedded with 180 spherical
  and rectangular notch defects of varying depths and dimensions, was fabricated using
  3D printing to serve as the experimental model. The laser-induced thermal data were
  acquired at three distinct scanning speeds and underwent temporal alignment to synchronize
  heating events across all pixels. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Independent
  Component Analysis (ICA) were subsequently applied to the aligned datasets to extract
  and isolate defect-related thermal signatures. PCA effectively reduced data dimensionality
  and highlighted major thermal diffusion patterns associated with significant defects,
  particularly notched anomalies. However, its sensitivity diminished for smaller
  or deeper defects. In contrast, ICA provided a more refined separation of thermal
  signals, enhancing defect visualization and contrast, especially at slower scanning
  speeds where higher heat input improved thermal differentiation. Notably, ICA demonstrated
  superior performance in isolating notched defects compared to spherical ones due
  to pronounced thermal gradients. The findings underscore the potential of combining
  flying spot thermography with PCA and ICA to enhance defect detection and characterization
  in NDT&E applications. Future work will focus on optimizing scanning parameters
  through simulation models and integrating machine learning algorithms to further
  improve the detection of smaller and shallower defects, thereby advancing the precision
  and efficacy of thermal analysis techniques. Â© 2025 The Author(s)
