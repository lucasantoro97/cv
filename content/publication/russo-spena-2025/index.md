abstract: Climate concerns are driving the automotive industry to adopt advanced manufacturing
  technologies that aim to improve energy efficiency and reduce vehicle weight. In
  this context, lightweight structural materials such as aluminium alloys have gained
  significant attention due to their favorable strength-to-weight ratio. Laser welding
  plays a crucial role in assembling such materials, offering high flexibility and
  fast joining capabilities for thin aluminium sheets. However, welding these materials
  presents specific challenges, particularly in controlling heat input to minimize
  distortions and ensure consistent weld quality. As a result, numerical simulations
  based on the Finite Element Method (FEM) are essential for predicting weld-induced
  phenomena and optimizing process performance. This study investigates welding-induced
  distortions in laser butt welding of 1.5 mm-thick Al 6061 samples through FEM simulations
  performed in the SYSWELD 2024.0 environment. The methodology provided by the software
  is based on the Moving Heat Source (MHS) model, which simulates the physical movement
  of the heat source and typically requires extensive calibration through destructive
  metallographic testing. This transient approach enables the detailed prediction
  of thermal, metallurgical, and mechanical behavior, but it is computationally demanding.
  To improve efficiency, the Imposed Thermal Cycle (ITC) model is often used. In this
  technique, a thermal cycle, extracted from an MHS simulation or experimental data,
  is imposed on predefined subregions of the model, allowing only mechanical behavior
  to be simulated while reducing computation time. To avoid MHS-based calibration,
  this work proposes using thermal cycles acquired in-line during welding via infrared
  thermography as direct input for the ITC model. The method was validated experimentally
  and numerically, showing good agreement in the prediction of distortions and a significant
  reduction in workflow time. The distortion values from simulations differ from the
  real experiment by less than 0.3%. Our method exhibits a slight decrease in performance,
  resulting in an increase in estimation error of 0.03% compared to classic approaches,
  but more than 85% saving in computation time. The integration of real process data
  into the simulation enables a virtual representation of the process, supporting
  future developments toward Digital Twin applications.
