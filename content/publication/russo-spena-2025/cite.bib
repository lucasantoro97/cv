 abstract = {Climate concerns are driving the automotive industry to adopt advanced manufacturing technologies that aim to improve energy efficiency and reduce vehicle weight. In this context, lightweight structural materials such as aluminium alloys have gained significant attention due to their favorable strength-to-weight ratio. Laser welding plays a crucial role in assembling such materials, offering high flexibility and fast joining capabilities for thin aluminium sheets. However, welding these materials presents specific challenges, particularly in controlling heat input to minimize distortions and ensure consistent weld quality. As a result, numerical simulations based on the Finite Element Method (FEM) are essential for predicting weld-induced phenomena and optimizing process performance. This study investigates welding-induced distortions in laser butt welding of 1.5 mm-thick Al 6061 samples through FEM simulations performed in the SYSWELD 2024.0 environment. The methodology provided by the software is based on the Moving Heat Source (MHS) model, which simulates the physical movement of the heat source and typically requires extensive calibration through destructive metallographic testing. This transient approach enables the detailed prediction of thermal, metallurgical, and mechanical behavior, but it is computationally demanding. To improve efficiency, the Imposed Thermal Cycle (ITC) model is often used. In this technique, a thermal cycle, extracted from an MHS simulation or experimental data, is imposed on predefined subregions of the model, allowing only mechanical behavior to be simulated while reducing computation time. To avoid MHS-based calibration, this work proposes using thermal cycles acquired in-line during welding via infrared thermography as direct input for the ITC model. The method was validated experimentally and numerically, showing good agreement in the prediction of distortions and a significant reduction in workflow time. The distortion values from simulations differ from the real experiment by less than 0.3%. Our method exhibits a slight decrease in performance, resulting in an increase in estimation error of 0.03% compared to classic approaches, but more than 85% saving in computation time. The integration of real process data into the simulation enables a virtual representation of the process, supporting future developments toward Digital Twin applications.},
