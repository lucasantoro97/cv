summary: Annual conference of italian scientific society mechanical design and machine design.
abstract: 'This study examines the fatigue behavior of 316L stainless steel produced via laser powder bed fusion (PBF-LB/M). Using surface roughness analysis, density measurements, fatigue testing, and thermographic analysis, the research estimates fatigue limits through methods like the Two-Component Model (TCM) and Murakami Method (MM). An innovative iterative approach to thermographic data links thermal emission to microstructural damage, allowing faster and more cost-effective material characterization. The method shows promise for evaluating fatigue properties in additively manufactured materials.'
