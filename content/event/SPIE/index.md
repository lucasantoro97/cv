summary: Presentation of two research papers on thermographic evaluation methods in welding, held at SPIE Thermosense in Orlando.

abstract: |
  I recently had the privilege of presenting two research papers at SPIE Thermosense in Orlando. It was a wonderful opportunity to exchange insights and discuss advancements in thermographic methods applied to welding processes. The first paper, "Use of frequency-based methods for quantitative evaluation of resistance spot welds," co-authored with Valentino Razza and Manuela De Maddis from Politecnico di Torino, introduces innovative frequency analysis techniques for assessing welding quality. The second, "Real-time thermographic monitoring for automated defect detection in welding," developed with Raffaella Sesana, presents a system for real-time defect analysis through infrared imaging, enhancing process reliability and quality control.

Iâ€™m excited to share that I recently had the privilege of presenting two research papers at **SPIE Thermosense** in Orlando! It was a wonderful opportunity to exchange insights and discuss advancements in thermographic methods applied to welding processes.

**The papers presented were:**

- **"Use of frequency-based methods for quantitative evaluation of resistance spot welds"**  
  Co-authored with *Valentino Razza* and *Manuela De Maddis* (Politecnico di Torino), this research introduces innovative frequency analysis techniques to quantitatively evaluate resistance spot welding quality.

- **"Real-time thermographic monitoring for automated defect detection in welding"**  
  In collaboration with *Raffaella Sesana* (Politecnico di Torino), this study demonstrates a real-time monitoring system using infrared thermography for automated detection and analysis of welding defectsâ€”enhancing process reliability and quality control.

A special thanks to my co-authors and the SPIE community for the enriching experience and fruitful discussions.

### ðŸš€ Commercial Application

This research has been successfully commercialized through **[Therness](/project/therness/)**, offering:

- **[QMS Copilotâ„¢](https://www.therness.com/therness-qms-copilot)** - AI-powered Quality Management System for ISO 9001 compliance with automated CAPA/PPAP workflows
