summary: 'Welded structures are fundamental to numerous engineering applications, including aerospace, automotive, construction, and maritime industries. The integrity of welded joints is critical to the overall safety and performance of these structures. This symposium aims to bring together researchers, industry professionals, and practitioners to discuss the latest advancements in the evaluation of structural integrity of welded components.'

abstract: 'The focus will be on comprehensive approaches to damage evaluation and assessment, fatigue behavior analysis, and the application of non-destructive testing (NDT) techniques in welding. By addressing these key areas, the symposium seeks to enhance understanding of the mechanisms affecting weld integrity and to promote innovative solutions for detecting and mitigating potential failures.
