      text: |-
        I'm a research scientist specializing in Non Destructive Testing and Machine Design. I currently work as a  Scientist at the Politechnic University of Turin. I frequently explore topics like fracture mechanics, computer vision, and the application of advanced testing methods in engineering.

        I employ both qualitative and quantitative approaches to deeply analyze the intersection of science, engineering, and technology in industry applications.

        **🚀 Spinoff Success:** My research has led to the creation of **[Therness](/project/therness/)**, a cutting-edge company specializing in AI-powered welding inspection systems that ensure 100% weld verification with zero guesswork.
