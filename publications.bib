	abstract = {This study presents the preliminary outcomes of a methodology for the physical and mechanical characterization of various chestnut elements in different states of preservation. Strategizing conservation and retrofit interventions for timber is necessary, and to do this, it is necessary to establish an estimation of physical (transmissivity, thermal conductivity, humidity level, etc.) and mechanical properties (density, compressive or bending strength, etc.). This essential information is typically associated with timber defects, but there are lack of correlations. The primary objective is to establish correlations between thermal and density properties with the aim of preserving original assets. The investigation delves into the relationship between timber density and thermal properties through experimental non-destructive testing (NDT). Two NDTs were employed with the aim of correlating: penetrometric testing and active thermography investigations. The parametric study on the excitation period yielded valuable insights into the temporal dynamics of heat transfer within the timber, underscoring the significance of selecting appropriate excitation periods to capture precise thermal properties. Tabular data on relative humidity for salified, dried, and new samples provided a quantitative backdrop to these observations, unveiling the nuanced effects of humidity on the timber’s thermal response. The results of this study are positioned to inform future conservation efforts by laying the groundwork for a comprehensive understanding of timber’s mechanical properties. Particularly, the challenge lies in accurately estimating density, where surface tests are often less reliable than in-depth ones. Therefore, it is crucial to seek validation through other NDT tests, such as thermographic analysis and visual inspection, and hygrometric tests recognizing their importance in enhancing the reliability of density assessments. This approach will contribute to the development of more discerning preservation strategies.},

	abstract = {This study presents a comprehensive understanding of the fatigue behavior of 316L stainless steel specimens produced using the laser powder bed fusion (PBF-LB/M) method. The
investigation has been conducted through a multifaceted approach that includes surface
roughness analysis, density measurements, microstructural examination, fatigue testing, strain
measurements, and thermographic analysis. Thermographic data processing models, i.e. the bipower law (TCM-modified) model and the TCM method, are applied to fatigue test results of
standard samples to evaluate fatigue limit values. The fatigue limit of the samples was estimated
using the Murakami Method (MM), Constant Amplitude Loading (CAL) and Step Loading (SL)
tests. The proposed methodology allows exploration of the entire stress level range within a
single test, which could allow evaluation of the fatigue limit of components within only one
test. This study is the starting point for a rapid evaluation method for estimating the fatigue
limit using thermography, offering a cost-effective, time-efficient, and non-destructive means of
assessing the fatigue performance of materials produced using additive manufacturing processes.},

	abstract = {The thermal and electrical responses of additive manufactured specimens were analysed for a additive manufactured steel magnetic shield as a case study. The analysis was based on the evidence that variations in the thermal properties of a material can be measured as a phase delay in thermal diffusion through the material bulk. The signal post-processing was performed, and the results were presented in a phase diagram. The results showed that after heat treatment, the slope of the phase diagram changed to less steep, indicating an increase in thermal diffusivity and hence thermal conductivity. The electrical conductivity was predicted using the thermal conductivity and the Weidemann-Franz law and validated by experimental measurements of the electrical conductivity. The same approach was applied to predict the electrical conductivity in the magnetic shielding, taking into consideration the scaling of the density due to porosity. The results showed that the thermographic non-destructive full field non-contact approach can be used to evaluate the electrical properties of a component and that the heat-treated specimens show better thermal diffusivity and hence thermal and electrical conductivity.},

The mechanical properties of spot welds are pivotal in ensuring structural integrity and overall assembly performance. In this work, the quality attributes of resistance spot welding, such as both nugget and corona bond sizes, are assessed by analyzing the thermal behavior of the joint using a physical information neural network (PINN). Starting from the thermal signal phase gradient and amplitude gradient maps, a convolutional neural network (CNN) estimates the size of nuggets and corona bonds.

	abstract = {Ancient wooden artifacts are vulnerable to deterioration from a variety of environmental and human factors. It is challenging to comprehend the assessment when the wooden part is placed inside a construction without performing a diagnostic procedure. While working with ancient wooden structures, tradition and preservation of the architectural, technological, and historical heritage are crucial. A series of non-destructive tests (NDT) must be carried out and developed in order to preserve and determine the nature of the structure and comprehend how to maintain it because wood is also a significantly heterogeneous material. Thermographic techniques are well recognized to be non-destructive, contactless, complete field techniques and are already common in the artistic sector. However, there is the possibility of estimating the physical properties (for example transmissivity, thermal conductivity, humidity level, etc.) and mechanical characteristics (density, compressive or bending strength, etc.), critical information, linked usually with wooden defects, when it comes to planning interventions of conservation. This work presents the preliminary results of a physical and mechanical characterization methodology of different chestnut elements in different states of conservation, with the aim of correlating thermal and density properties, for the purpose of conserving artistic assets.},

	abstract = {The non-destructive full-field non-contact thermographic technique is applied for non-destructive flaw detection of the welded joints, in real-time and offline configuration. In this paper, a thermographic procedure for real-time flaw detection in manual arc welding process is presented. Surface temperature acquisitions by means of an IR camera were performed during arc welding process of 8 specimen both for calibration and validation of the numerical model. The investigated variables are the technique (manual stick arc (SMAW) and gas arc (GMAW) welding) and the joint shape (butt and T joint) for steel joints, in sound conditions and with artificial flaws. Numerical simulation of welding thermal transients was run to obtain the expected surface temperature fields and thermal behavior for different welding parameter configurations. Hardness measurement and micro-graphic analysis were performed to validate numerical simulation results. The real-time thermographic study of the weld pool gives direct indications of anomalies; local studies of the thermal transient and thermal profiles can detect some kind of flaws; microstructural analysis of Heat-Affected Zone (HAZ) and surrounding areas higlights the presence of austenite and martensite distribution which justifies the thermal transients and thermal profiles for different welding configurations. Comparing real-time IR acquisition of the welding process with simulated thermal contours of sound processes provides information of presence of some kind of flaws. Since most of the flaws are generated in the weld pool, it is possible to recognize anomalies directly from the thermal acquisitions or with post-processing the acquired data.},
