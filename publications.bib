   abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive framework integrating infrared (IR) thermography, electrode surface imaging, and welding process parameters to provide robust non-destructive evaluation (NDE) of resistance spot welded (RSW) joints. Employing lock-in thermography with digital analysis of carbon copy electrode imprints, our method accurately captures variations in weld nugget characteristics linked to electrode geometry and wear conditions. Metrics such as weld area, circularity, and phase gradient magnitude extracted from thermal images highlight the influence of electrode contact conditions on the resulting weld quality. The results demonstrate the capability of thermal imaging to rapidly detect subtle weld inconsistencies arising from electrode degradation or uneven pressure distributions. This unified, data-driven approach effectively bridges traditional destructive methods and advanced NDE techniques, enabling continuous, real-time quality monitoring and enhanced weld integrity assurance in high-volume manufacturing environments.},

   abstract = {Welding quality is quite critical in manufacturing. This work provides a method to enhance defect detection in robotic welding by combining statistical approaches with real-time thermographic monitoring. A robotic arm welds, and an infrared camera records temperature data. After segmentation and morphological processing, key features are extracted and optionally smoothed (e.g., via Savitzky–Golay). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reduces dimensionality, and an Isolation Forest then identifies anomalies that may indicate defects. The approach aims to minimize human involvement, improve homogeneity, and integrate statistical robustness, thereby enhancing the dependability and efficiency of robotic welding techniques.},

   abstract = {The aim of this paper is to introduce and validate an iterative algorithm for the rapid assessment of the fatigue limit. The algorithm is based on the analysis of intrinsic dissipation and offers a more efficient alternative to traditional fatigue testing methods. An iterative method is applied to thermal data and dissipative data collected during cyclic loading tests. Passive thermography is used to monitor surface temperature increments, which are indicative of microstructural damage. The dataset is iteratively divided into regions above and below a hypothesized fatigue limit, and curve fitting is performed on each subset. The algorithm seeks to minimize the error between experimental data and the fitted curves, ensuring continuity at the estimated fatigue limit. The proposed iterative method provides a reliable and rapid estimate of the fatigue limit, significantly reducing the number of tests needed compared to conventional methods. The results demonstrate good agreement between predicted and experimental fatigue limits, particularly in additively manufactured materials with complex microstructures. This method offers a cost-effective and time-efficient solution for evaluating the fatigue performance of materials produced via additive manufacturing. It is especially useful in applications where rapid material characterization is required.},

   abstract = {Climate concerns are driving the automotive industry to adopt advanced manufacturing technologies that aim to improve energy efficiency and reduce vehicle weight. In this context, lightweight structural materials such as aluminium alloys have gained significant attention due to their favorable strength-to-weight ratio. Laser welding plays a crucial role in assembling such materials, offering high flexibility and fast joining capabilities for thin aluminium sheets. However, welding these materials presents specific challenges, particularly in controlling heat input to minimize distortions and ensure consistent weld quality. As a result, numerical simulations based on the Finite Element Method (FEM) are essential for predicting weld-induced phenomena and optimizing process performance. This study investigates welding-induced distortions in laser butt welding of 1.5 mm-thick Al 6061 samples through FEM simulations performed in the SYSWELD 2024.0 environment. The methodology provided by the software is based on the Moving Heat Source (MHS) model, which simulates the physical movement of the heat source and typically requires extensive calibration through destructive metallographic testing. This transient approach enables the detailed prediction of thermal, metallurgical, and mechanical behavior, but it is computationally demanding. To improve efficiency, the Imposed Thermal Cycle (ITC) model is often used. In this technique, a thermal cycle, extracted from an MHS simulation or experimental data, is imposed on predefined subregions of the model, allowing only mechanical behavior to be simulated while reducing computation time. To avoid MHS-based calibration, this work proposes using thermal cycles acquired in-line during welding via infrared thermography as direct input for the ITC model. The method was validated experimentally and numerically, showing good agreement in the prediction of distortions and a significant reduction in workflow time. The distortion values from simulations differ from the real experiment by less than 0.3%. Our method exhibits a slight decrease in performance, resulting in an increase in estimation error of 0.03% compared to classic approaches, but more than 85% saving in computation time. The integration of real process data into the simulation enables a virtual representation of the process, supporting future developments toward Digital Twin applications.},
